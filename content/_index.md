Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer from the Netherlands ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±, currently working on the [SpiderMonkey](https://spidermonkey.dev) JavaScript engine at [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org). I started contributing to SpiderMonkey in 2010 when I was still in college. I was hired by Mozilla after I graduated.

I'm interested in compilers, dynamic language implementations, and software performance and security.
